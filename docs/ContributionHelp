  Branch Policy
  Sending pull requests:
   
  Say you want to contribute changes to someone else’s repository (eg, this one).
   
  It is advisable to clone only the development branch using following command:
  Go to the repository on github. (Say it’s by myfriend, and is called the_repo, then you’ll find it at http://github.com/myfriend/the_repo.)
   
  git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>
  Click the “Fork” button at the top right.
   
  Example:
  You’ll now have your own copy of that repository in your github account.
   
  git clone -b my-branch git@github.com:user/myproject.git
  Open a terminal/shell.

  Type
  
  $ git clone git@github.com:username/the_repo
  where username is your username.
  
  You’ll now have a local copy of your version of that repository.
  
  Change into that project directory (the_repo):
  
  $ cd the_repo
  Add a connection to the original owner’s repository.
  
  $ git remote add myfriend git://github.com/myfriend/the_repo
  Note the distinction between git@github.com: in the first case and git://github.com/ in the second case. I’m not sure why these need to be the way they are, but that’s what works for me.
  
  Also note the first myfriend does not need to be the same as the username of myfriend. You could very well choose:
  
  $ git remote add repo_nickname git://github.com/myfriend/the_repo
  To check this remote add set up:
  
  $ git remote -v
  Make changes to files.
  
  git add and git commit those changes
  
  git push them back to github. These will go to your version of the repository.
  
  Note: if you get an error like:
  
  error: src refspec master does not match any.
  error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:username/the_repo'
  Then try git push origin HEAD:gh-pages (see stackoverflow.). Typing git show-ref can show what reference to put after HEAD.
  
  Go to your version of the repository on github.
  
  Click the “Pull Request” button at the top.
  
  Note that your friend’s repository will be on the left and your repository will be on the right.
  
  Click the green button “Create pull request”. Give a succinct and informative title, in the comment field give a short explanation of the changes and click the green button “Create pull request” again.
  
  Pulling others’ changes
  Before you make further changes to the repository, you should check that your version is up to date relative to your friend’s version.
  
  Go into the directory for the project and type:
  
  $ git pull myfriend master
  This will pull down and merge all of the changes that your friend has made.
  
  Now push them back to your github repository.
  
  $ git push
